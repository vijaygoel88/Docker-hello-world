## 🐳 What is Docker Hub?

Docker Hub is a **cloud-based registry** for container images, similar to how GitHub works for code. It allows you to:

- Store Docker images
- Share them publicly or privately
- Collaborate with others
- Pull official and community images

---

## 🔓 Public vs Private Repositories

| Type        | Access              |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Public      | Anyone can view/pull |
| Private     | Only selected users |

- Free accounts get **1 private repo**
- Pro/Team plans unlock more private repos

---

## ⚙️ How Docker Hub Works (Behind the Scenes)

When you run:

```sh
docker pull ubuntu
```

Docker:
- Checks local cache
- Pulls image layers from Docker Hub registry
- Caches them locally for reuse

---

## 🧾 Create a Docker Hub Account

1. Visit [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email
4. Login and create a repository

---

## 🚀 Docker Push Workflow

```sh
docker login
docker tag hello-world-app:latest vijaygoel/devopsvijay123:latest
docker push vijaygoel/devopsvijay123:latest
```

🔁 To remove an old tag:

```sh
docker rmi vijaygoel/devopsvijay123:tagname
```

Once pushed, your image is available on Docker Hub.

---

## 📥 Pulling Images from Docker Hub

```sh
docker pull nginx
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
```

This runs the official **nginx** image on port 8080.

---

## ✅ Official vs Community Images

| Official Images         | Community Images         |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Maintained by Docker or trusted orgs | Created by users |
| Regularly updated       | May not be maintained    |
| Security-scanned        | Check manually           |

Always check:
- 🔄 Update frequency
- 🐞 Vulnerability scan
- 🧾 Dockerfile
- 📊 Number of pulls

---

## 🔖 Tagging & Versioning Best Practices

```sh
docker tag my-app:v1.0 vijaygoel/my-app:1.0
docker push vijaygoel/my-app:1.0
```

- Avoid relying only on `latest`
- Use semantic versioning like `1.0.1`, `2.3.4` for predictability

---

## 🔐 Docker Hub Security Tips

- 🔒 Use 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)
- 🧼 Don’t hardcode secrets in Dockerfiles
- 🕵️‍♀️ Use vulnerability scanning
- 🔐 Keep sensitive images private
- 🔁 Rotate access tokens regularly

---

## 🛠️ Alternatives to Docker Hub

| Platform                   | Description                |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| GitHub Container Registry | Integrates with GitHub     |
| Amazon ECR                | Great for AWS users        |
| Google Artifact Registry  | Ideal for GCP pipelines    |
| JFrog Artifactory         | Enterprise-ready & self-hosted |
